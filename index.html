  <h2 id="tribute-info">Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1914 - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
    <li>1941 - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</li>
    <li>1953 - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
    <li>1984 - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>
    <li>2009 - dies at the age of 95</li>
